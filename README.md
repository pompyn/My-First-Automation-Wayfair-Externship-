My-First-Automation-Wayfair-Externship-
Built an automated workflow using n8n that runs on a scheduled trigger, executes custom logic via JavaScript, and routes data through conditional paths using an If node. This workflow demonstrates event-based automation, dynamic decision-making, and branching logic — foundational skills for AI agent and cloud automation design.

🤖 My First Automation Workflow
Platform: n8n
Tech Stack: JavaScript • Conditional Logic • Workflow Automation
Status: Completed (Wayfair Externship – Module 1)

🧭 Overview
This project demonstrates a foundational automation workflow built in n8n, featuring scheduled triggers, inline JavaScript processing, and conditional branching with dynamic data output.
It serves as the base framework for future AI-powered and multi-cloud automation projects.

⚙️ Workflow Components
🕒 1. Schedule Trigger
Initiates the workflow automatically at defined intervals — simulating real-world, event-driven automations such as:

Daily health checks
Data refresh routines
Alert system triggers

🧩 2. Code in JavaScript
Executes a custom script to define and manipulate data before evaluation.
This introduces programmable control inside a visual workflow environment.

🔀 3. If Node
Applies conditional logic to determine which execution path to follow:

If condition == true → perform Action A  
Else → perform Action B
